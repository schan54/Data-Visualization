                    <p class="initialText">Glaciers help keep the Earth cool. Without glaciers, temperatures can rise to be much higher. They can be as old as several thousand years old, which allows them to provide a scientific record of how climate has changed over time. By studying them, scientists are able to learn just how fast the climate is changing. By losing these glaciers, we are also losing these pieces of history. About 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already gone.</p>

	 <!-- paragraph explaining visual-->
	 <p class="white-text">Here we see recorded data of the mass of different glaciers from 1979 to 2017, measured in gigatons. The middle circle shows each glacier that data was recorded for. Each color represents a different glacier. Some of the glaciers do not show their names, however hover the mouse over each glacier will allow for you to view the name of the glacier. The outer circle shows the data recorded for each glacier. Some of the larger data is viewable in the main portion of the visual, however if you select a glacier with smaller masses, the graph will zoom in and show the data for glaciers with smaller masses. If you hover over any of the data points, the graph will show you the year the mass was taken and the mass of the glacier in gigatons.</p>

                    <!-- paragraph explaining how large the data changes are-->
                    <p class="initialText">The changes may seem small, but they are much larger than expected. The units the mass is measured in is gigatons, which to put into perspective is about the same weight as 6 million blue whales, or about 400,000 olympic pools filled with water. Between 1990 and 2015, the Totten glacier lost about 5 gigatons of ice, or about the same mass as 30 million blue whales. These changes can be seen in both individual glaciers and entire regions of Antarctica.</p>

                    <!-- paragraph pertaining to Thwaities Glacier ice loss/importance/predictions-->
                    <p class="initialText">An important glacier scientists are currently worried about is the Thwaities Glacier in West Antarctica. Currently there is a 300 meter tall cavity forming at the base of the glacier, which could cause sea levels to significantly rise if it grows larger and causes ice to break off from the glacier. The glacier itself is currently responsible for 4% of sea level rise. The glacier also acts as a baracade, preventing ice more inland from melting and running into the ocean. Overall, the loss of the Thwaities Glacier could raise sea levels to approximately 2400 mm.</p>

                 <!-- paragraph pertaining to East Antarctica, and how it is losing its stability, Totten Glacier is losing ice -->
                 <p class="initialText">East Antarctica, on the opposite side of the Thwaities Glacier, used to be considered a more stable area of Antarctica pertaining to ice loss but has scientists now concerned. The Totten Glacier area, along with other glaciers that make up approximately one-eigth of Antarctica, have been significantly losing ice within the last decade. Totten, the largest glacier in East Antarctica, has lost about 3 meters of surface height due to ice melting between 2008 and 2013. The changes to East Antarctica are small in comparison to the changes in West Antarctica, but they show how changes to Earth's climate</p>

	<!-- conclusion -->
	<!-- <p class = "white-text">As we can see, nothing is guaranteed. Our planet gets worse and worse every day. Sea level rise continues to surpass it's predictions each year and new areas of glaciers begin to melt. Sea level rise poses an imminent threat to our way of life, considering how it is on a path to slowly destroy all our coastal cities. </p> -->
