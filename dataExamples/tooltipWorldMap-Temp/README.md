this iteration uses [d3 version 4](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md)

the changes to update from d3v3 to d3v4 were pretty straightforward - mostly camelCasing scale names.  a goal of this series of examples is to make it easier for someone learning to use d3 to understand what is happening.  One way to do that is to make a whole new example at each new conceptual change.

do check out the other examples in this `world map` series:
