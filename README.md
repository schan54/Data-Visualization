# Data-Visualization

Github Repo for our group, "*Data Visualization*". We are a four computer science undergraduates studying at UCSC. This repo features the our work done over the past quarter and is broken via branches as well as various directories.

Individual branches feature initial programming works attempted at the begining of the quarter. After sprint 1, we then merged our individual work into the master branch

The master branch holds the real guts of the project. The core website is located in the co2 folder and can be run locally.
  * co2  --> Containts the entire website. Run this dir locally to view
  * dataSets --> Contains all of our data files in various formats. It also contains the needed parsers used to generate the outputs
  * scrumDocs --> Logistic documents here
  * website --> Legacy folder that will be cleaned
  * worldMaps --> Legacy folder that will be cleaned
